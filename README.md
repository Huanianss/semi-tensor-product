## STP Toolbox for Python

A Semi-tensor product toolbox adapted from matlab version
http://lsc.amss.ac.cn/~hsqi/soft/STP.zip



## What is STPï¼Ÿ

The semi-tensor product (STP) of matrices is a novel matrix product, which is a generalization of conventional matrix product for the case when the two factor matrices even do not meet the dimension matching condition.



## Install 

```Python
pip install semi-tensor-product
```



## Usage

``` Python
import numpy
import stp
A=np.array()
B=np.array()

# performs the (left) semi-tensor product of two matrices
C=stp.sp(A,B)  

# performs the (left) semi-tensor product of finite set of matrices
C=stp.spn(A,A,B)
```

Please see `example01.py ` and `example02.py ` for more use cases.
